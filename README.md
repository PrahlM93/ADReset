# ADReset (Not Maintained)

## About
ADReset is a self-service Active Directory password reset portal. Written with Bootstrap 3, it is fully responsive, and thus works flawlessly on any device, including mobile phones. ADReset allows a user to securely reset their password using secret questions defined by an administrator or by having a reset link sent to their email (the email address is defined in Active Directory). The server-side code is written entirely in PHP and thus it should work on any webserver or operating system.
